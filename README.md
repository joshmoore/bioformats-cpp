# OME Files C++

OME Files is a standalone C++ library for reading and writing life sciences
image file formats. **Development has migrated to https://gitlab.com/codelibre/ome-files !**

Purpose
-------

OME Files' primary purpose is to convert proprietary microscopy data
into an open standard called the OME data model, particularly into the
OME-TIFF file format. See the [statement of
purpose](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/about/index.html)
for a thorough explanation and rationale.  OME Files provides support
for reading and writing files using the OME-TIFF file format and for
the OME metadata model which is the basis for the file format.


Supported formats
-----------------

OME-TIFF using the OME metadata model.

For users
---------

[Many software
packages](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/users/index.html)
use Bio-Formats to read and write open microscopy formats such as
OME-TIFF in Java programs.  OME Files provides equivalent
functionality for C++ programs.


For developers
--------------

You can use OME Files C++ to easily support OME-TIFF in your software.
